            <div class="answer">Abdulselam Taye, a fourth-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Addis
                Ababa University, majoring in the Electronics Communication stream, with a passion for computer
                engineering and software-focused careers.<br>

            <div class="question">How is life going?</div>
            <div class="answer">From what I see, you're handling a lot—balancing engineering studies, research,
                teaching, and software development. That’s impressive!

                You seem driven and ambitious, always looking to learn and improve, whether it’s coding, public
                speaking, or business analysis. </div>

            <div class="question">Next steps ahead?</div>
            <div class="answer">As I progress in my academic and professional journey, balancing engineering studies,
                software development, research, and teaching requires strategic planning and focus. Moving forward, my
                key priorities include completing my research on system losses in Ethiopian banks, strengthening my
                software development skills, and advancing my analysis of educational platforms in Ethiopia.
